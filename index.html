            The nowcast of the output gap is based on the method described in 
            <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3586374">Berger, Morley, and Wong (2020)</a>.
            Please cite the paper when referring to the nowcast estimate.<br><br>

            The nowcast for the current quarter in which real GDP has not yet been
            released is reported in the figure using an orange line from the actual
            estimated output gap for previous quarters.
            The actual estimated output gap is based on parameter estimates using data
            from 1967-2019 for the mixed-frequency Bayesian VAR specified in 
            <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3586374">Berger, Morley, and Wong (2020)</a>
             and data up to the latest quarter for which real GDP has been released from 
            <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">FRED</a>. 
            The monthly variables that feed into the nowcast are specified in the table in bold.<br><br>


            The slider below the figure allows for different scenarios for the remaining monthly variables.
            When the slider is set to 0, the remaining monthly variables for the current
            quarter are based on conditional forecasts from the MF-BVAR.
            When the slider is set to values between 1 and 6, it corresponds to scenario nowcasts with a severity factor for certain monthly variables compared to their average trajectory x- months after a recession and assuming the COVID-19 recession began in March 2020, while other variables set to specific values.<br><br>
